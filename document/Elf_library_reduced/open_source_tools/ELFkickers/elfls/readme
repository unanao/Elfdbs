elfls is a simple utility that displays an ELF file's program and
section header tables. These tables serve as a roadmap to the rest of
an ELF file's contents. The purpose is to provide a quick, top-level
view of an ELF file's organization.

If requested, elfls will also display the file's dependencies and
source code filenames.

The output is a bit terse, similar to the long format of ls, and
therefore also a bit cryptic. Refer to the manpage for a full
description of the program's output.

For more in-depth information regarding a file's contents, objdump(1)
should be used.
