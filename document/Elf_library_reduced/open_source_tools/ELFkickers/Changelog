* May 2001: version 2.0a

	Two small bug fixes, reported to me by people who downloaded
	version 2.0.

* April 2001: version 2.0

	I began spelunking in the system header files <elf.h> and
	<linux/elf.h> again, and discovered a large number of new
	definitions. I realized that the ELF standard could be going
	through major changes, and that having a version number is really
	necessary.

	elftoc updated to understand some of these new additions, and
	elsewhere restructured so as to make it easier to update it again
	once I understand the rest of them.

	Fixes for elftoc bugs that I noticed during the rewrite.

	elfls updated similarly to elftoc.

	Minor rewrite of sstrip to make the code more airtight and
	aesthetically pleasing.
	
* March 2001

	rebind added to ELF Kickers.

	date and snake added to the tiny collection.

	cat removed from the tiny collection (too uninteresting).

	Cleaned up all tiny programs and made them more stylistically
	consistent.

	Minor bug fix in elftoc.

	Documentation cleanups.

* February 2001

	Five of the tiny programs did not work under 2.2.17 and later 2.2
	kernels due to a change in how Linux checks the ELF header.
	(Thanks to Francois-Rene Rideau, who pointed this out to me. Oddly
	enough, this new restriction does not seem to have made it into
	the 2.4.0 kernel. I am unsure if the change is confined to the 2.2
	versions, or if it will resurface in a later kernel.) I succeeded
	in fixing two of the programs without sacrificing compatibility
	with 2.0 kernels or increasing the size. For the other three, I
	added new versions specifically for 2.2.17 (et al).

* January 2001

	keepalive added to the tiny collection.

	Removed -W option from the Makefile for ebfc (I thought I had done
	this already).

	New feature added to ebfc -- namely, the acceptance of compressed
	source files -- just for the heck of it.

	This file added.

* August 2000
	
	After installing a 2.2 kernel, I discovered that changes to the
	system header files and a new warning in gcc 2.95.2 caused several
	of the programs to generate numerous compiler warnings and errors.
	The errors were caused by a benign redefinition of a macro, and
	were suppressed by changing the inclusion order of the system
	header files in question. The warnings were due to my taking
	advantage of of the standard feature of omitting trailing
	initializers in the definition of a structure, and were suppressed
	by omitting the -W gcc option in the Makefiles, leaving just
	-Wall.

	ls added to the tiny collection.

	Bug fixes and minor improvements to the documentation.

* July 1999
	
	Initial release. Main programs: elfls, elftoc, sstrip, ebfc. In
	the tiny collection: true/false, hello, fgconsole, hexdump, cat,
	factor.
